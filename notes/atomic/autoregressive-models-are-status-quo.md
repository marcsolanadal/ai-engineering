# Autoregresive models are status quo
---

Autoregressive models are the most common models. They're trained to predict the next word. ChatGPT o3 says it's an autorregressive model.
LLMs are fancy completion machines. They complete words based on the previous tokens. The most critical pitfall of those models is that the have **hallucinations**. They confidently say something that it's not true or grounded to reality.

To me, humans feel like prediction machines with a solid world model, memory and an a way of learning with small training sets.
